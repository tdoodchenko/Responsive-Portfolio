        <p>My name is Taylor Doodchenko. I have a marketing diploma from George Brown College and have worked for two
            years
            in digital marketing, developing digital marketing strategy and doing web content management for a large
            Ontario
            financial Institution. In highschool I took a introductory computer programming class but I didn't really
            become
            interested in coding until being tasked with building a website for a subsidiary, life insurance company.
            Although
            I only acted as a liaison between the developers and the costumer, during construction of the site I was
            exposed
            to some of the underlying code while managing content. I became curious and immediately wanted to learn
            more.
            I am xcited to be taking on this new journey towards becoming a full stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>A little more about me: I was born in a small town in Ontario and lived there for most of my life. I am a
            huge follower
            of baseball and hockey. Music is another passion of mine; I play guitar and love to write music when time
            permits.
            My music interests ranges from classical to heavy metal, so don't even ask... </p>

            industry's standard
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
            type
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
